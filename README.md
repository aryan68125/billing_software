This application is a python app built for desktops using a Tkinter library that is inbuilt in python. 
For the database, I used the SQLite database. It is a GUI desktop application.
It also can send the bill to the customer using their email address.

3. Feel free to check the source code If you have any doubt
4. Download the exe file from releases section
